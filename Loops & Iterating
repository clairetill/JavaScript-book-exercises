1. Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Input/Output chapter. The updated code should use a for loop to display the future ages.

let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
let age = readlineSync.question('How old are you? ');
age = parseInt(age);
console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
for (let future = 10; future <= 40; future += 10) {
  console.log(`In ${future} years, you will be ${age + future} years old.`);
}

2. Write a function that computes and returns the factorial (see exercise 4 in the Functions chapter) of a number by using a for loop. You may assume that the argument is a valid non-negative integer.

function factorial(number) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let counter = number; counter > 0; counter -= 1) {
    result *= counter;
  }

  return result;
}

3. The following code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?

let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}

The problem occurs on line 3 where we assign 1 to counter inside the conditional part of the while loop. JavaScript accepts this code since the assignment always returns a truthy value (1 in this case), the loop condition never becomes false. Furthermore, the test on line 7 never becomes true since the assignment on line 3 ensures that counter is always equal to 2 when we execute line 7.

4. Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

The code doesn't produce an error since all 3 components of the for loop are optional. In this code, we omit the "next value" component; however, this isn't a problem here since we increment the loop variable on line 2.
