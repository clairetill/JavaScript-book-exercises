1. Concatenate two or more strings, one with your first name and one with your last, to create a string with your full name as its value. For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put 'John' and 'Doe' together to get 'John Doe'.

'Claire' + ' ' + 'Tillinghast'

2. Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

> let number = 4936
> let ones = number % 10
> ones
= 6

> number = (number - ones) / 10
= 493

> let tens = number % 10
> tens
= 3

> number = (number - tens) / 10
= 49

> let hundreds = number % 10
> hundreds
= 9

> let thousands = (number - hundreds) / 10
> thousands
= 4
