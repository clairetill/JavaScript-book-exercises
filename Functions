1. What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);


The code logs 1 to the console. foo doesn't affect the value assigned to bar on line 1 since JavaScript functions create an inner scope. Thus, the bar variable on line 3 is not the same as the one on line 1. In the end, foo() has no bearing on the final output.

2. In the exercises for the previous chapter, you wrote a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. Add a function to this program that solicits the user's first and last names in separate invocations; the function should return the appropriate name as a string. Use the return values to greet the user with their full name.

function getName(prompt) {
  let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
  let name = readlineSync.question(prompt);
  return name;
}

let firstName = getName('What is your first name? ');
let lastName = getName('What is your last name? ');
console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);

3. Write a program that uses a multiply function to multiply two numbers and returns the result. Ask the user to enter the two numbers, then output the numbers and result as a simple equation.
function multiply(left, right) {
  return left * right;
}

function getNumber(prompt) {
  let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
  return parseFloat(readlineSync.question(prompt));
}

let left = getNumber('Enter the first number: ');
let right = getNumber('Enter the second number: ');
console.log(`${left} * ${right} = ${multiply(left, right)}`);

4. Use the times function shown below to write a program that logs the value of 1! (one factorial), 2! (two factorial), 3!, 4!, and 5! (five factorial) to the console.

let oneFactorial = times(1, 1);
let twoFactorial = times(2, oneFactorial);
let threeFactorial = times(3, twoFactorial);
let fourFactorial = times(4, threeFactorial);
let fiveFactorial = times(5, fourFactorial);

5. What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');

6. What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee');

This program also doesn't log anything. The function returns a value, Yipeee!!!!, but it doesn't do anything with it. In particular, it doesn't write it to the console.
